I am a multi-line
string with no indent
%

    % this line is ignored
    this line is kept
        so is this, and is indented 4 spaced
    %

this line is read as a single trimmed string
this line has an escaped newline char\
and continues on the next line

be careful of unquoted commas, though
these 2 lines actually end up as 3 values

true, false, null
